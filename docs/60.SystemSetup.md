| Field          | Note       |
| -------------- |:--------------------|
| LCD auto off   | The timer to turn LCD/backlight off.	0 to keep it always on. |
| LCD Display   | Selection of **Rotate**, **BrewPi**, and **Additional**. |
| Title         | The name shown on the homepage, next to LCD.	|
| Host/Network Name         | SSID and hostname	|
| HTTP Port        | port of HTTP protocol.	|
| User Name/password         | Username and password to access certain pages |
| Always need password | If enabled, you will be asked username/password when trying to connect to it. |
| Network Mode | Station, AP, Station+AP: set the network operation mode of BPL |
| Network |  Selected SSID. Click to show WiFi network settings.|
| IP | Current assigned IP if available. |
| SYSINFO |  |
| BACKUP/RESTORE | To backup/restore settings, including system, device, MQTT, gravity device, and pressure monitoring. |


Note: Change of all settings except `LCD auto off` will result in re-boot of BPL. The setting of LCD auto off is supposed to be effective right away after submit.

If Network is set Station+AP mode, BPL will create a WiFi network even when it is connecting to a AP. It is useful and good to set Station+AP mode when working with iSpindel. In most case, BPL is placed near the fermenter, so it is near iSpindel, which should solve connection issue of iSpindel, if any, and save the power of iSpindel.

New in 4.2, there is a new "screen" of display for additional available information, including Pressure, Humidity, Gravity device, and IP. If **Rotate** is selected, the display will rotate between classic BrewPi display and the **Additional** display every 5 seconds. Or, dedicated display can be selected. However, when the rotary encoder, if avaiable, is pushed, the display will always change to BrewPi display for fermentation control setup. Rotating rotatary encoder will rotate the disply under non-setting mode. If **DISPLAY_ISPINDEL** option, only available for OLED
option, is set to 'true', the Additional screen will be dedicated to iSpindel information. 

Note: due to burn-in effect of OLED LCD, rotating is a better choice even you don't need the other display.
