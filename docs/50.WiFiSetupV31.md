After v3.1, WiFiManager is no longer used, and SoftAP mode is always enabled. To connect BPL to the internet or your Access Point, go to "config" page:

![Config.htm](image/systemconfig.jpg?raw=true)

Change "Network Mode" to "AP + Station" if not already done.

Click the button after the "Network", and network selection page will show. Scan, select and save, just like what in WiFiManager.
