BrewPiLess can run on [SONOFF Basic](https://www.itead.cc/wiki/Sonoff) and [SONOFF TH10/16](https://www.itead.cc/wiki/Sonoff_TH_10/16). You will need to solder the header pins for the first flashing and install temperature sensors. However, because of the small 1M byte flash memory, you will either sacrifice 
* OTA web update for log storage, or
* 500k log storage for OTA update
* LCD is not available.

SONOFF dual is not supported, because the Relays are controlled by Serial instead of GPIO.Instead, SONOFF Dual **R2** should work by specify correct PINs.

Please note that some older SONOFFs, maybe before 2018, use ESP8266 while new ones use ESP8285. Right configuration must be used.

### ESP32 SonOff devices (Sonoff TH Origin and Sonoff TH Elite)

For Sonoff TH Elite the built-in lcd display can be removed and a OLED LCD screen can be connected in it's place.. Use electrical tape to make sure that the LCD pcb is not touching the main pcb. The front glass is a thin plastic be gentle with it. 

##### Relay Pins
16A devices: 21
20A devices: 19 and 22 for the latching relay

#### Conntecting sensor
The sensor that has the RJ9 connector comes with a controller in the wire that needs to be removed
Option 1: Remove the controller and reconntect the wires (not tested).
Option 2: Use  `Sonoff AL010 2.5mm Audio Jack to RJ9 Adapter` with the old sensor using the audio jack conntector.

#### Connecting OLED LCD (optional)
* Connect SDA to WR solder pad
* Connect SCL to CS solder pad
* Use hotglue over soldered contacts so that you don't ripoff the solder pads accidentally. 
* Connect 3v and Gnd to corresponding solderpads

#### ðŸš§ Workaround for 20A Sonoff Origin and Elite

20A Sonoff devices use bi-stable or latching relays controlled by 2 pins. One pin need to be assigned as Chamber heater even though there is no heater.. In that way when the cooler pin turns off and the fridge is not really off. But soon the algorithm would kick in and start the heater that does not exist and that would turn the fridge off.
