BrewPiLess can run on [SONOFF Basic](https://www.itead.cc/wiki/Sonoff) and [SONOFF TH10/16](https://www.itead.cc/wiki/Sonoff_TH_10/16). You will need to solder the header pins for the first flashing and install temperature sensors. However, because of the small 1M byte flash memory, you will either sacrifice 
* OTA web update for log storage, or
* 500k log storage for OTA update
* LCD is not available.

SONOFF dual is not supported, because the Relays are controlled by Serial instead of GPIO.Instead, SONOFF Dual **R2** should work by specify correct PINs.

Please note that some older SONOFFs, maybe before 2018, use ESP8266 while new ones use ESP8285. Right configuration must be used.

### ESP32 SonOff devices (Sonoff TH Origin and Sonoff TH Elite)

For Sonoff TH Elite the built-in lcd display can be removed and a OLED LCD screen can be connected in it's place.. Use electrical tape to make sure that the LCD pcb is not touching the main pcb. The front glass is a thin plastic be gentle with it. 

#### Conntecting sensor
The sensor that has the RJ9 connector comes with a controller in the wire that needs to be removed
Option 1: Remove the controller and reconntect the wires (not tested).
Option 2: Use  `Sonoff AL010 2.5mm Audio Jack to RJ9 Adapter` with the old sensor using the audio jack conntector.

##### Connecting OLED LCD (optional)
* Connect SDA to WR solder pad
* Connect SCL to CS solder pad
* Use hotglue over soldered contacts so that you don't ripoff the solder pads accidentally. 
* Connect 3v and Gnd to corresponding solderpads
