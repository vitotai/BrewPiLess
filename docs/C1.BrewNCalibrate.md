After version 4.4, the calibration data survives through brews. The maximum number of calibration pairs is 10.

When starting a log, the calibration data available will be written into the log file, so that tilt angles are recorded and gravity can be derived from the tilt angles. Otherwise, gravity data is recorded.

The "Calculated by BPL" option determines whether or not using the gravity reported directly, while "Record Raw" option when starting logging determines whether or not recording raw data instead of gravity values. These two options are independent but related.

| Calculated by BPL | Record Raw | Gravity of BPL | Gravity of Log |
| --  | -- | -- | -- |
|  ON | ON | calculated by BPL, need calibration data | calculated on the fly, need calibration data    |
| ON  | OFF |calculated by BPL, need calibration data | gravity calculated by BPL |
| OFF | ON | gravity reported from wireless hydrometer | calculated on the fly, need calibration data. |
| OFF | OFF | gravity reported from wireless hydrometer | gravity from BPL, reported from wireless hydrometer|

The calculated gravity is always temperature corrected. When inputing new data from main page, corrected gravity will be calculated automatically if beer temperature is available. However, no temperature correction is available if calibration data is input at "gravity device" page.
